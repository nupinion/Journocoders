# Journocoders

For the amazing Journocoders meetup group, we have created an overview on databases. We cover relational databases (mysql), document stores (Elasticsearch) and graph databases (neo4j).

The notes are intended to provide both a superficial overview and more advanced options for those who wish to practice further.

All comments for improvements welcome.
