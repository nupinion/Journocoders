# Journocoders

For the amazing Journocoders meetup group, we have created an overview on databases. We cover three different types of databases:

* relational databases (mysql), 
* document stores (Elasticsearch), 
* and graph databases (neo4j).

The notes are intended to provide both a superficial overview and more advanced options for those who wish to practice further.

We have split out the notes into two folders: `LocalSetup` and `Tutorial`. The first is purely to inform you about how to setup the databases and data on a local machine and holds all the data-conversion scripts. The latter is to follow the Tutorials as run for the Journocoders workshop.

All comments for improvements welcome.
